  **STEPS : **
  
1. Fork the repo.

2. Clone the fork repo into your local machine.

```git clone <the-repo-link>```

3. Create an upstream on your local machine to pull the latest code from the main branch of the repository

```git remote add upstream <the-url-where-you-fork-this-repo>```

4. Create a new branch on your local machine. The command below will create a new branch and then switch to the branch

```git checkout -b <branch-name>```

5. Make changes to the code

6. Commit changes to the branch and push to your forked repo.

```git add .
   git commit -m "<commit-message>"
   git push origin <branch-name>
```

7. Come back to this repo and open a pull request on the branch you created.

   switch to the branch you created on the repo. By doing that you would have seen a button that said *compare/pull request*. press the button, which will then take you to a 
   
   page to provide the title and description for the pull request. After that, then press the pull request button to submit a pull request. With that you are done, it's left for      the reviewer to *review* and *merge*
   
   **Do not merge your pull request yourself. Wait for review and merging from the coordinator.**
